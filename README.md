# Portfolio

In this section I will be showcasing some of the projects related to:
-My master's degree in Data Science
-Courses related to Data Science from Codecademy, Udemy...
-Kaggle Datasets that I find interesting to work with

The objective is to show the different areas of Data Science I have been working with such as Machine Learning, Natural Lenguage Processing.
The ones that are coded with R are probably related to the masters degree, the Python ones are projects I have done outside of the master.
